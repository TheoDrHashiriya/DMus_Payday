# Doom Dynamic Music: PAYDAY (Ongoing)
- A music pack that adds tracks from the Payday series to Doom. The control phases of each song are played whenever the player is not in combat and then transitions to the assault phases when in combat.
- The control and assault phases are seamlessly looped with the help of ZDoom's audio looping feature and Audacity.
- Due to the current state of the mod, the anticipation phases of each track cannot be implemented like in the Payday games unfortunately.
- Please do report any inconsistencies and issues with the audio looping and volume. I'm terribly nitpicky about those.
- Suggestions are welcome in the issues page.

## Pros & Cons
#### Pros
- Boosts morale.
- Increases operation speed.

#### Cons
- Increases mortality rate.
- Non-ideal for long operations; Novelty fades.
- [Known Issues](https://github.com/TheoDrHashiriya/DMus_Payday#known-issues--their-solutions).

## Usage
1. Download DoomDynMus [here](https://github.com/cyberc001/DoomDynMus/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Download the music pack [here](https://github.com/TheoDrHashiriya/DMus_Payday/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. Load both the mod and the music pack into GZDoom.

## Known Issues (& Their Solutions)
- If the game freezes on level start, see this [issue page](https://github.com/cyberc001/DoomDynMus/issues/2) for a temporary solution.
- The game will crash with a VM execution aborted error in some instances. Although it was fixed by cyberc001, it still persists at times.\
The current available workaround is to press the Escape button and start a new game. For more info, here's the [issue page](https://github.com/cyberc001/DoomDynMus/issues/1).
